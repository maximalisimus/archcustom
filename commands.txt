By default, there really are no settings at all - 
neither the user's "skel", nor the "release" version information, 
nor the "sudo" rights settings, nor even the usual automatic login without a password, 
and even "customize_airootfs.sh " basic settings after installation in the working directory 
before assembling the root of the image file system and assembling the image itself.





Edit to:
1) mkarchiso
2) profiledef.sh
3) packages.x86_64
4) airootfs
5) pacman.conf



1) mkarchiso:
search pacstrap install command and insert "-i" in two strings.



2) profiledef.sh:
iso_name

add file_permissions
  ["/etc/gshadow"]="0:0:0400"

3) packages.x86_64
Line by line, separate the packages that you need in the final distribution. 
Comment out everything you don't need. 
You can make several different sections of packages marked with comments, what are these sections.

4) airootfs:
As a rule, any administrative tasks that you normally do after a new installation 
can be performed in a script archlive/airootfs/root/customize_airootfs.sh, 
except for installing packages. 
The script must be written from the perspective of the new environment, 
so / in the script means the root of the ISO image that is being created.

The "airotfs" folder is like the root directory of your future system 
and all settings and how your future system will look depend on it.

5) pacman.conf:
The future settings of the package manager depend on it in 2 places during 
the build of the distribution kit and in the very future distribution kit 
already inside the image.


Build:
$ sudo su
$ mkdir -p ./work ./out
$ pacman -Scc
$ ./mkarchiso -v -w ./work/ -o ./out/ ./

Clear:
$ rm -rf ./work/*

ISO to ./out folder.
